**Motivation** - Kart Rating is the second custom statistic created for Kartnite Stats. The goal of Kart Rating was to fix some of the problems that the Kart Score had. Such as being a purly cumulative stat, not incorporating average, and relying on total races played heavily

**Goal** - Kart Rating should be a metric that fixes some of the flaws of Kart Score by incorporating the newly tracked all time stats.

**How is Kart Rating calculated?**

There are 3 aspects that go into the calculation of Kart Rating, GP Wins, Average Points, and Tracks Owned. All three of these aspects are non-clumative meaning that total races is not going to be directly correlated with your Kart Rating.

Kart Rating is similar to the QBR static in football. There is a maximum score that can be attained which would be considered a Perfect Mario kart Player. The maximum possible score is a 153. 

This 153 points broken down into those three categories from before, 60 points are from GP wins, 60 Points are from track average, and 33 points are from tracks owned.

GP Wins - This is calculated by the percentages of GPs won by the total amount of GPs that you played multiplied by the 60 possible points. Meaning if a player played 10 GPs and won 5 of those they would be given 30 Kart Rating Points out of the 60 possible in this category. A perfect Mario Kart Player would win 100% of the GPs that they play and thus only then would all 60 points be given

Average Points - This is calculated similarly to GP Wins. A players average is divided by 15, which is a perfect average, and then multiplied by the 60 possible points given for this category. A perfect player would win every race so 60 points would be given to player with a 15 point average. A player with a 12 point average would be given 48 of the possible 60 points.

Tracks Owned - The Players of Kartnite Stats play a total of 33 different tracks, all of the 32 normal tracks, plus Lava Lake. The owner of each track is given 1 point per track owned. 

Conclusion - The Kart Rating is definitely a step in the right direction in terms of a metric in which could determine the best overall Mario Kart Player. However it is not perfect. A person that goes 1/1 in a GP would be scored higher then a player who goes 9/10 across 10 GPs which does not seem to be a great scenario for this metric. So far using Kart Rating in combination with Kart Score is probably the best way to determine who the best player is.
